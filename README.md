# idleWorld
An idle game based off [Idle Online Universe](https://iourpg.com). Work in progress. 

**NOTE**: Because this is being written in my offline text editor and not directly on GitHub, this will probably not be the most updated version there is.  
Check out my [dev blog on Kongregate.](https://www.kongregate.com/forums/4-game-programming/topics/955548-2017-2018-challenge-making-another-semi-idle-game)
The game has also been released (as a Pre-Alpha version) on Kregate. Check it out [here!](https://www.kongregate.com/games/hazard_Gamer/pre-alpha-idle-world)
